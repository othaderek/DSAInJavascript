# Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript

## Introduction

I want to get really good at Data Structures and Algorithms and Javascript is my preferred scripting languages so I decided to create this Github repo as a way to hold myself accountable and as a future reference guide. This repo will contain the space/time complexities, and explanations of the best time to use each of the following algorithms:

- Problem Solving Patterns
    - [x] Frequency Counter
    - [x] Multiple Pointers
    - [x] Sliding Window
    - [x] Divide and Conquer

- Searching
    - [ ] Linear Search 
    - [x] Binary Search 
    - [ ] Naive String Search 
    - [ ] Depth First Search
    - [ ] Breadth First Search

- Sorting
    - [x] Bubble Sort 
    - [ ] Selection Sort 
    - [ ] Insertion Sort  
    - [x] Merge Sort 
    - [ ] Quick Sort 
    - [ ] Radix Sort 

and the implementation of the following data structures:

- [x] Singly Linked Lists
- [ ] Doubly Linked Lists  
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues 
- [ ] Binary Search Trees
- [ ] Binary Heaps 
- [ ] Hash Tables 
- [ ] Graphs && Graph Traversal 
- [ ] Djikstra's Algorithm 

Enjoy!
