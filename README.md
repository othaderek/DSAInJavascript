# Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript

## Introduction

I want to get really good at Data Structures and Algorithms and Javascript is my preferred scripting languages so I decided to create this Github repo as a way to hold myself accountable and as a future reference guide. This repo will contain the space/time complexities, and explanations of the best time to use each of the following algorithms:

- Searching
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search [x]
    - Naive String Search

- Sorting
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Radix Sort

and the implementation of the following data structures:

- Singly/Doubly Linked Listst
- Stacks && Queues
- Binary Search Trees && Tree Traversal
- Binary Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs && Graph Traversal
- Djikstra's Algorithm

Enjoy!
